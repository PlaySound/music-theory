#### A model of a musical scale.

In music theory, a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch.

[Musical Scale on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music))

A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a descending scale. Some scales contain different pitches when ascending than when descending. For example, the Melodic minor scale.
